# Length converter - PHPUnit data provider sample

## Purpose
Example of data providers in PHP unit tests with PHPUnit.

The system under test is a `Length` class with the following specification:
- Constructor. It receives as parameters the length of the original value and its measure system (`I` - Imperial or `M` - Metric).
- `Convert()`. It returns the conversion of the length value to the opposite measure system.
